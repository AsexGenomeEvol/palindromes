MCScanX: tool used by the springtail people to identify collinear genes block, and thus palindromes
	How to determine if collinear genes block are palindromic or not ? Tandem reapeats ?

MCScanX about and download page
	http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/
	Can be installed on linux OS, should we install it on vital-it and try it ?

	16/10/17: 

	Goal is to use MCScanX (which seems to be the go-to package for palindrome detection)
	to reproduce the results of the springtail paper using their data
	

	ran into an error when installing MCScanX:
"make
g++ struct.cc mcscan.cc read_data.cc out_utils.cc dagchainer.cc msa.cc permutation.cc -o MCScanX
msa.cc: In function ‘void msa_main(const char*)’:
msa.cc:289:22: error: ‘chdir’ was not declared in this scope
     if (chdir(html_fn)<0)
                      ^
makefile:2: recipe for target 'mcscanx' failed
make: *** [mcscanx] Error 1
"

	found a fix on package's github:
"if you are building on 64-bit you may need to add
	#include <unistd.h>
to msa.h, dissect_multiple_alignment.h, and detect_collinear_tandem_arrays.h"

	ran into a new error when installing MCScanX:

	fix: openjdk is not installed...
	get installed package: dpkg --get-selections | less | grep 'jdk'
openjdk-8-jre:amd64				install
openjdk-8-jre-headless:amd64			install
	purge those packages: sudo apt-get purge openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jre-headless
	install new packages: sudo apt-get install openjdk-9-jre openjdk-9-jdk

	successful installation (yee but linux is tryhard if you're a newbie - took me way too much time)
	now beginning to try using MCScanX
	from manual: MCScanX needs 2 input for the standard and easy use
	1) direct Blastp result (available from the data site, using swissprot as db): .blast file
	2) gene annotations (also available) : .gff file
	
	try of generating the .blast file (following manual):
jklopfen@acer:~/palindromes/MCS-test$ blastall -i fcan_proteins.fa -d nr -p blastp -e 1e-10 -b 5 -v 5 -m 8 -o fcan.blast
Warning: [blastp] The parameter -num_descriptions is ignored for output formats > 4 . Use -max_target_seqs to control output
BLAST Database error: No alias or index file found for protein database [nr] in search path [/home/jklopfen/palindromes/MCS-test::]
Program failed, try executing the command manually.

	then with the two files avaiable from the site (renamed original .blastout file to .blast for program requirements):
jklopfen@acer:~/palindromes/MCS-test$ ls fcand*
fcand.blast  fcand.gff

	(in another folder where the programm is installed, for it weighs 241.5 MB and cannot be in git repo)
jklopfen@acer:~/fp/MCScanX$ ./MCScanX MCS-test/fcand

	Results of "hail mary" try: 
	html file is empty, collinearity results file is also empty
	the command obviously failed, need to better understand what I was actually doing and ask for help maybe
	Possible reasons: blastp file was not the one expected for the program, gene annotation file may contain duplicate


	18.10.17:
	Will try generating the blastp results out of the example command from the manual
	problem was that there was no database for the genome, will use the command 'makeblastdb'
	then use the 'typical command'

makeblastdb -in fcand_genome.fa -dbtype prot

blastall -i fcand_genome.fa -d fcandgenome.fa -p blastp -e 1e-10 -b 5 -v 5 -m 8 -o fcan.blast
